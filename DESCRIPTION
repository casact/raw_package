Title: R Actuarial Workshops
Description: In order to facilitate R instruction for actuaries, we have organized several 
  sets of publicly available data of interest to non-life actuaries. In addition, we suggest 
  a set of packages, which most practicing actuaries will use routinely. Finally, there is 
  an R markdown skeleton for basic reserve analysis.
